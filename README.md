# openhistoricaltiles
First iteration of vector tiles from OHM Planet data

We'll be using a fork of OpenMapTiles, https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/openmaptiles, and then this repo will be mostly for issues related to our implementaiton, though we might also commit style JSON files and other ancillary items here when they don't belong inside our install of OpenMapTiles.

The OpenHistoricalMap planet file (as of July 9 2018) may be had from https://greeninfo.slack.com/files/UAAD2PM5Z/FBKD5RN95/ohm-20180612.osm.pbf  This link is specificaly for GIN staff.
